# *THE VERSE*
one of my favorite verses in hip-hop doesn't even come from hip-hop artist, but I find it beautiful. 

Food and liquor stores rest on every corner

From 45th and State to the last standing Henry Horner

J&J's, Harold's Chicken, good finger lickin'

While they sin, gin, sin sin at Rothschild's and Kenwood Liquors

The winos crooked stagger

Meets the high stride of the youth searching for the truth

They rebel and raise hell across alleyways and in classroom settings

They get, high off that drum bass and 20/20 rims

They rock braids, Air Force Ones and Timbs

They drink Hennessy, Hypnotiq and 40's

They call they women hoes, bust downs and shorties

They keep funeral homes in business and gunshot wards of hospitals full

Prisons packed, bubbling over in brown sugar

They keep empty, Westside lots crowded, hype's powdered

The well is running dry, the days of Malcolm and Martin have ended

Our hope has descended and off to the side

Waiting for the re-installment of the revolution

Because we are dying at the cost of our own pollution

But God has another solution, that has evolved from the hood

I present one who turns, the Fiasco to good

The person that wrote and spoke this is Lupe Fiasco's sister, Ayesha Jaco. 


# *Calvin and Hobble*
Something else that's cool is Calvin and Hobbles. A cute lil comic book strip you can probably find on a newspaper.
